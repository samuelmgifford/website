## Shiny Applications: Interactive Teaching Tools

I use the following web applications to demonstrate statistical concepts in my Econometrics and Statistics for Economics classes. Source code is available on github


### [Sampling](https://samuelmgifford.shinyapps.io/sampling/) (Econ 300 - Econometrics)

Demonstrates sampling distribution and central limit theorem 

### [Sampling Distribution](https://samuelmgifford.shinyapps.io/SamplingDistribution/) (Econ 270 - Statistics for Economics)

A step-by-step version of the above application for introductory class to highlight what exactly a sampling distribution is, rather than just focusing on the limit. 

### [Confidence Interval](https://samuelmgifford.shinyapps.io/ConfidenceInterval/) (Econ 270 - Statistics for Economics)

This is meant to highlight the difference between a confidence interval and a sampling distribution. Confidence intervals are likely to contain the true mean if modeling assumptions are met, but they are only in expectation centered around the true mean

### [Correlation](https://samuelmgifford.shinyapps.io/correlation/) (Econ 300 - Econometrics) 

Demonstrates the determinates of linear regression and gives a feel for different values of the correlation coefficient 

## Teaching Slides

I write all slides and assignments using quarto/rmarkdown. The raw markdown and rendered files/links are available on my github account: [Statistics for Economics](https://github.com/samuelmgifford/econ270), [Econometrics](https://github.com/samuelmgifford/Econ300)
