Hello! I'm Sam, a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the University of Illinois Chicago. 

<p>
</p>


I started my career as an actuary at Allstate where I specialized in predictive analytics and R programming. After developing my skills, I transitioned to a software engineering role in trading technology at Milliman Financial Risk Management. Now I research financial economics and teach undergraduate statistics and econometrics. I have broad expertise in statistics, analytics, programming, and business strategy and finance that are well suited to data science and quantitative finance positions. I have also developed strong leadership and communication skills by leading projects and teaching courses.

In my current research I mostly employ causal analytics with data mining and natural language processing applied to SEC 10-K documents and proxy statements. You can find examples of my work in the <a href="/projects/"> projects</a> and <a href="/research/"> research</a> pages of this site, as well as on my <a href="https://github.com/samuelmgifford/">github</a>.
